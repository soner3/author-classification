# Author Identification using Text Mining and Machine Learning

This project aims to classify texts based on their authorship using traditional ML models and deep learning approaches (BERT). The dataset consists of multiple authors and their respective documents.

## Folder Structure

- `data/raw/dataset_authorship/`: Original dataset
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and labeled data
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature extraction, and modeling
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and evaluation

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
